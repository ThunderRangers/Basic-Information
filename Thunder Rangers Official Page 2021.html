        <hr class = "hr2">
        <div id = "p2">
            <br>
      <p> This is our team Thunder Rangers. Its our beloved team. Today I'm gonna tell you about our team's biodata.
          Its established in 2015. Two members named Rupom and Priom started the beginning of this team. From the 
          very fast beginning, our team was ignorable as a team. Because it didn't consist such a good number of members. 
          Two years later, in 2017, Neer joined the team. They were then 5 members, Rupom, Priom, Neer, Saad and Nafi. 
          After that, a few months later, I(Taisir) also joined the team. I started thinking then, I dreamed to make this 
          sport group of only 7 members a real team. Then I started hard working from that time. And after a long time, in
          2020, the Coronavirus year, our team was started adding with more members. Then, on a total, 10 members joined 
          our team with the passage of time. From the then, in 2018, 2019 and 2020, I was voted the leader of Thunder
          Rangers. Now, our team constitutes 17 members in total. I'm very glad now for being successful in making my
          beloved team a real team Alhamdulillah. Thank you.
      </p>
